I'm rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beats made for two
'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said it's nice to have your friends round
We're watching a television with no sound

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out

Push your lack of chest out look at my hair
Gotta love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with Rocks and Brown
And fucking the whole towns
A reflection on your mental health
'Cause I remembered when I found you
Much younger than you are now
Once it started I am friend zone
You created a television in your mouth

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out

You've got something to say
Why don't speak it out loud
Instead of living in your head
It's always to say why don't you take your heart out
Instead of living in your head

It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out
